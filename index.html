        <p>As you probably would have guesed, my name is Sam and I'm actually not sure what I am (career-wise). In college I studied Crossmedia Design, which basically made me a Jack of all trades. In my three-year long education I learned about graphic design, motion design, web development and business. Learning all these things in only 3 years led to the fact I can do all these things, well enough, but I can't say I mastered a particular one of them. Sure enough I'm able to do the basic tasks en play out my role in a company, but I don't have a specialty. </p>
        <p>That is where the Treehouse Techdegree comes in. Moving forward from now on, I want to master the skills of a Front End Engineer and with my design background, I hope to be the person customers/companies need. But most of all, be proud of my skill set and my work.</p>

          <h2 class="hello_title">My Goals</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I would like te learn all about Front End Development and allow myself to create beautiful webpages. But this is not the only thing I want to learn, I would love to think about how webpages function and the user can have the best experience. Diving in that UX/UI department also stands on my bucket list. Even if I will not use it in my day to day job, it most defintely will come in handy as background knowledge as a front end developper.</p>
