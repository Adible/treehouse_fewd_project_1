        <p>Below this paragraph you can read some more about what I learn throughout my school and work careers. <br>
            My experience goes from design, to user interfaces, motion graphics, wordpress and much more.</p>

        <p>In school I had the opportunities to do some interships, one was about UI and customer relations and one as a graphic designer. In both of these internships I learned a lot and I had a great time at them. They really showed me what it is to be working at a company full time. The first internship was in a startup so I could choose my own working path, but the second one was in a company of +-50 employees so the rules were laid out for me. I enjoyed both equally as much. </p>

        <p>My first real job was a junior User Interface designer at a start-up in the heart of Antwerp. It was my first work experience (not as u student) and it became clear that I had to be independant from my co-workers, but as a junior designer you really need that bit of help to learn more and to do your best work. Unfortunately they could not provide this aid due to an overload of work. My second job was at larger communcition bureau where did a lot of different things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social media images</li>
            <li>Motion design</li>
            <li>Book design</li>
            <li>Webdesign</li>
            <li>Presentation desgin</li>
